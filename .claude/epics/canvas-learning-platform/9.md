# Task: Authentication System

## Description

Implement a comprehensive multi-role authentication system using Supabase Auth with Flutter integration. This includes login/registration flows, role-based access control for students/teachers/administrators, session management, and profile management functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-role authentication implemented (student, teacher, administrator roles)
- [ ] Login and registration flows created with email verification
- [ ] Password recovery and reset functionality working
- [ ] Role-based navigation and UI access controls implemented
- [ ] User profile management interface created
- [ ] Session management with automatic token refresh
- [ ] Authentication state management using Riverpod
- [ ] OAuth integration ready (Google/Apple for future enhancement)
- [ ] Authentication guards implemented for protected routes
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for auth failures

## Technical Details

### Authentication Components
- **AuthService**: Supabase Auth wrapper with role management
- **AuthProvider**: Riverpod provider for authentication state
- **AuthGuard**: Route protection middleware
- **LoginScreen**: Email/password authentication interface
- **RegisterScreen**: New user registration with role selection
- **ProfileScreen**: User profile management and settings
- **ResetPasswordScreen**: Password recovery functionality

### Implementation Approach
- Use Supabase Auth for secure authentication backend
- Implement GoRouter authentication guards for route protection
- Create responsive authentication UI for mobile and web
- Set up role-based permissions using Supabase RLS integration
- Implement secure session storage using Flutter Secure Storage
- Add biometric authentication support for mobile devices
- Create comprehensive authentication error handling and user feedback

### Key Files/Locations
- `/lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Authentication service layer
- `/lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Riverpod state management
- `/lib/screens/auth/` - Authentication UI screens
- `/lib/guards/auth_guard.dart` - Route protection
- `/lib/models/user_profile.dart` - User data models

## Dependencies

- [ ] Database Foundation task (001) completed - requires profiles table
- [ ] Supabase Auth configured with RLS policies
- [ ] Flutter dependencies: supabase_flutter, riverpod, go_router
- [ ] Understanding of secure authentication patterns
- [ ] Mobile-specific auth requirements (biometrics, secure storage)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 20-28 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on database foundation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All authentication flows implemented and tested
- [ ] Role-based access control working correctly across the app
- [ ] Authentication state persists across app restarts
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] Mobile and web authentication experiences are consistent
- [ ] Security review completed for authentication flows
- [ ] Unit tests written for authentication service and providers
- [ ] Widget tests created for authentication UI components
- [ ] Integration tests verify complete authentication workflows
- [ ] Authentication documentation updated with usage examples
