# Task: Multi-tenant UI Implementation

## Description
Implement role-specific user interfaces and dashboards for students, teachers, and administrators. This includes creating adaptive navigation, role-based feature visibility, and responsive layouts optimized for different user workflows and access patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Student dashboard with course progress, assignments, and upcoming classes
- [ ] Teacher dashboard with course management, student progress overview, and administrative tools
- [ ] Administrator dashboard with system metrics, user management, and content oversight
- [ ] Role-based navigation menu that adapts based on user permissions
- [ ] Responsive design that works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Theme system with Material Design 3 and custom Canvas branding
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) across all role interfaces
- [ ] Performance optimization with lazy loading and efficient state management

## Technical Details
- **State Management**: Implement Riverpod providers for role-specific state
- **Routing**: Configure GoRouter with authentication guards and role-based route protection
- **UI Components**: Create reusable widgets for dashboard cards, progress indicators, and navigation
- **Theme System**: 
  - Custom Material Design 3 theme with Canvas color palette
  - Dark/light mode support with user preference persistence
  - Responsive breakpoints for mobile (< 600px), tablet (600-1200px), desktop (> 1200px)
- **Key Components to Build**:
  - `StudentDashboard` - Course tiles, progress bars, upcoming assignments
  - `TeacherDashboard` - Course management, student analytics, grading queue
  - `AdminDashboard` - System metrics, user management, content moderation
  - `RoleBasedNavigation` - Dynamic menu based on user permissions
  - `ResponsiveLayout` - Adaptive sidebar/bottom navigation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database Foundation (001) - User profiles and role definitions
- [ ] Authentication System (002) - Role-based access control
- [ ] Course Management (003) - Course data for dashboard displays
- [ ] Flutter project structure and basic routing established
- [ ] Riverpod state management configured
- [ ] Design system and component library setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L (Large)
- Hours: 32-40 hours
- Parallel: false (sequential after core systems)

## Definition of Done
