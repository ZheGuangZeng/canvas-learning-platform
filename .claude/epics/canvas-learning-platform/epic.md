# Epic: Canvas Learning Platform

## Overview

Canvas Learning Platform is a modern, cloud-native LMS built with Flutter + Supabase + LiveKit. The implementation follows a progressive deployment strategy (local dev → cloud → self-hosted) with TDD methodology. The platform provides multi-tenant architecture supporting students, teachers, and administrators with real-time collaboration features including video conferencing and instant messaging.

**Core Technical Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Flutter 3.24+ (Web + Mobile PWA)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Realtime + Auth + Storage)
- **Video/Audio**: LiveKit (WebRTC-based real-time communication)
- **Project Management**: CCPM with GitHub Issues integration

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Flutter-First Approach**
- **Decision**: Single codebase for web, iOS, Android using Flutter
- **Rationale**: Faster development, consistent UX, mobile-first design
- **Trade-offs**: Learning curve, platform-specific optimizations limited

### 2. **Supabase as Backend-as-a-Service**
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL + real-time subscriptions + authentication
- **Rationale**: Rapid development, built-in security (RLS), self-hosting option
- **Trade-offs**: Vendor dependency mitigated by open-source self-hosting

### 3. **LiveKit for Real-time Communication**
- **Decision**: WebRTC-based video/audio with < 100ms latency
- **Rationale**: Professional-grade video quality, scalable to 1000+ participants
- **Trade-offs**: Additional service dependency, bandwidth requirements

### 4. **Progressive Deployment Strategy**
- **Decision**: Local development → Supabase Cloud → Self-hosted
- **Rationale**: De-risk deployment, provide flexibility, meet data sovereignty needs
- **Trade-offs**: Complex deployment pipeline, testing across environments

### 5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- **Decision**: Unit tests → Widget tests → Integration tests → E2E tests
- **Rationale**: High-quality code, faster debugging, confident deployments
- **Trade-offs**: Upfront time investment, disciplined development process required

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

#### Core UI Architecture
- **State Management**: Riverpod for reactive state management
- **Routing**: GoRouter for declarative navigation with authentication guards
- **Theme System**: Material Design 3 with custom Canvas branding
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for mobile, tablet, desktop

#### Key Widget Components
- **AuthenticationFlow**: Login, registration, password recovery
- **DashboardViews**: Role-specific dashboards (student/teacher/admin)
- **CourseComponents**: Course cards, lesson players, progress indicators
- **VideoCallInterface**: LiveKit integration with controls and participant grid
- **ChatComponents**: Real-time messaging with file sharing
- **AssignmentSystem**: Creation, submission, grading interfaces

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Route-based code splitting for faster initial load
- **Image Caching**: Aggressive caching with compressed thumbnails
- **Offline Support**: Critical data cached for offline access
- **Progressive Loading**: Content loaded incrementally as needed

### Backend Services

#### Supabase Database Schema
```sql
-- Core Tables: profiles, courses, enrollments, assignments
-- Real-time Tables: messages, chat_rooms, lesson_progress
-- Media Tables: file_storage metadata with signed URLs
-- Analytics Tables: usage_logs, performance_metrics
```

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-role Auth**: Students, teachers, administrators with different permissions
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with automatic refresh
- **SSO Integration**: Ready for SAML/OAuth2 (future enhancement)

#### Real-time Features
- **Chat System**: Supabase Realtime for instant messaging
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time lesson completion updates
- **Notifications**: Push notifications via service workers
- **Collaborative Features**: Shared whiteboards and document editing

#### API Design
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Standard CRUD operations via Supabase client
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: WebSocket connections for live features
- **File Handling**: Supabase Storage with CDN-optimized delivery
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with user-friendly messages

### Infrastructure

#### Deployment Environments

**1. Local Development**
```bash
supabase start  # Local PostgreSQL + APIs
flutter run -d chrome  # Hot reload development
```

**2. Cloud Deployment (Supabase Cloud)**
```bash
supabase deploy  # Managed PostgreSQL + global CDN
flutter build web --release  # Production web build
```

**3. Self-hosted Deployment**
```bash
docker-compose up  # Supabase + Flutter in containers
kubernetes apply  # Scalable orchestration (optional)
```

#### Monitoring & Observability
- **Application Metrics**: Flutter performance monitoring
- **Database Monitoring**: Supabase dashboard + custom queries
- **Video Quality**: LiveKit analytics and call quality metrics
- **User Analytics**: Privacy-compliant usage tracking

#### Security Implementation
- **Database Security**: RLS policies, SQL injection prevention
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, sanitization
- **Content Security**: File upload scanning, content moderation
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR/FERPA data handling procedures

## Implementation Strategy
