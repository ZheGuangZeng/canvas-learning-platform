# Task: Testing Infrastructure Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) infrastructure with unit tests, widget tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Establish automated test execution, coverage reporting, and quality gates to ensure 90% code coverage and reliable functionality across all deployment environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test suite covering business logic with 90% code coverage
- [ ] Widget tests for all UI components with golden file comparison
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical user journeys across roles
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Code coverage reporting with quality gates
- [ ] Performance testing framework for load and stress testing
- [ ] Test data management and cleanup automation

## Technical Details
- **Unit Testing Framework**:
  ```dart
  // Using Flutter's built-in test framework
  testWidgets('Course card displays correct information', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(CourseCard(course: mockCourse));
    expect(find.text(mockCourse.title), findsOneWidget);
  });
  ```
- **Widget Testing with Golden Files**:
  - Snapshot testing for UI consistency
  - Responsive layout testing across screen sizes
  - Theme testing (light/dark mode validation)
  - Accessibility testing with semantic labels
- **Integration Testing**:
  - Supabase client integration testing
  - LiveKit video call integration testing
  - Real-time messaging and notifications
  - File upload and storage functionality
- **End-to-End Test Scenarios**:
  - Student enrollment and course completion workflow
  - Teacher course creation and management
  - Administrator user and content management
  - Live video class with multiple participants
  - Assignment submission and grading process
- **Performance Testing**:
  - Load testing with up to 1000 concurrent users
  - Database query performance benchmarking
  - Video call quality and latency measurement
  - Mobile app performance profiling
- **Test Automation**:
  ```yaml
  # GitHub Actions workflow
  - name: Run Flutter tests
    run: |
      flutter test --coverage
      genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
  ```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Flutter project structure established
- [ ] Test runner agent configuration
- [ ] Mock data generators for consistent test scenarios
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup for automated execution
- [ ] Supabase local instance for integration testing
- [ ] LiveKit test environment for video call testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L (Large)
- Hours: 36-44 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside features using TDD)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Unit test suite implemented with 90% minimum code coverage
- [ ] Widget tests cover all custom components with golden file snapshots
- [ ] Integration tests validate all API endpoints and real-time features
- [ ] End-to-end tests cover complete user workflows for all three roles
- [ ] Automated test execution integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Code coverage reporting with failing builds below 90% threshold
- [ ] Performance test suite measuring load capacity and response times
- [ ] Test data management system for repeatable test scenarios
- [ ] Mock services configured for isolated unit testing
- [ ] Load testing results validate 1000 concurrent user capacity
- [ ] Security testing integrated to scan for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test documentation with examples and best practices
- [ ] Quality gates prevent deployment of untested code
