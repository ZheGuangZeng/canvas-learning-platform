# Task: Progressive Deployment Pipeline

## Description
Implement a three-stage progressive deployment pipeline: Local Development → Supabase Cloud → Self-hosted Infrastructure. This includes automated CI/CD pipelines, environment-specific configurations, database migrations, and monitoring across all deployment targets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Local development environment with Supabase CLI and Flutter hot reload
- [ ] Supabase Cloud deployment with production database and CDN
- [ ] Self-hosted deployment using Docker containers and optional Kubernetes
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management
- [ ] Database migration strategy across all environments
- [ ] Monitoring and health checks for each deployment target
- [ ] Rollback capabilities and disaster recovery procedures

## Technical Details
- **Local Development Setup**:
  ```bash
  supabase start  # Local PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Auth
  flutter run -d chrome --dart-define-from-file=env/local.json
  ```
- **Cloud Deployment (Supabase Cloud)**:
  - Managed PostgreSQL with automatic backups
  - Global CDN for static assets and media files
  - Serverless Edge Functions for API extensions
  - Built-in monitoring and analytics dashboard
- **Self-hosted Deployment**:
  ```yaml
  # docker-compose.yml
  services:
    supabase: # PostgreSQL, PostgREST, GoTrue, Realtime
    flutter-web: # Nginx serving Flutter web build
    reverse-proxy: # Traefik/Nginx with SSL termination
  ```
- **CI/CD Pipeline Components**:
  - Flutter build and test automation
  - Database schema validation and migration
  - Security scanning (dependency vulnerabilities)
  - Performance testing and regression detection
  - Automated deployment with approval gates
- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Development: `env/local.json` (local Supabase)
  - Staging: `env/staging.json` (Supabase Cloud staging project)  
  - Production: `env/production.json` (Supabase Cloud or self-hosted)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Multi-tenant UI (007) - Complete application for end-to-end testing
- [ ] All core features implemented (database, auth, courses, video, chat, assignments)
- [ ] GitHub repository with proper branch protection and workflow setup
- [ ] Supabase Cloud project provisioned with staging/production instances
- [ ] Domain registration and SSL certificate management
- [ ] Docker/Kubernetes infrastructure for self-hosted option

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL (Extra Large)
- Hours: 40-48 hours
- Parallel: false (requires complete system for testing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Local development environment setup documented and tested
- [ ] Supabase Cloud deployment successfully serving production traffic
- [ ] Self-hosted deployment option available with Docker containers
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline automated with all stages (test, build, deploy)
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations properly managed and secured
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully across all environments  
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured for application and infrastructure metrics
- [ ] Load testing completed with 1000 concurrent users
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Security scanning integrated into pipeline with no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validated across all deployment targets
- [ ] Documentation completed with deployment guides for each environment
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures tested and validated
