# Task: Database Foundation

## Description

Establish the core database foundation for the Canvas Learning Platform using Supabase PostgreSQL. This includes designing and implementing the complete database schema with proper relationships, setting up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenant architecture, and creating seed data for development and testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete database schema created with all core tables (profiles, courses, enrollments, assignments, messages, chat_rooms, etc.)
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented for all tables with proper role-based access control
- [ ] Database migrations created and tested for schema deployment
- [ ] Seed data scripts created for development environment with sample users, courses, and content
- [ ] Database performance optimizations applied (indexes, constraints, triggers)
- [ ] Supabase local development environment configured and tested
- [ ] Database documentation created with ERD and table descriptions
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Components
- **Core Tables**: profiles, courses, enrollments, assignments, submissions
- **Real-time Tables**: messages, chat_rooms, lesson_progress, notifications  
- **Media Tables**: file_storage metadata with signed URLs, course_content
- **Analytics Tables**: usage_logs, performance_metrics, user_sessions

### Implementation Approach
- Use Supabase CLI for local development and migration management
- Implement comprehensive RLS policies for student/teacher/admin roles
- Set up database triggers for automatic timestamp updates and audit logging
- Create stored procedures for complex business logic (enrollment, grading)
- Design efficient indexes for query performance
- Implement soft deletes for data retention requirements

### Key Files/Locations
- `/supabase/migrations/` - Database migration files
- `/supabase/seed.sql` - Development seed data
- `/docs/database/` - Database documentation and ERD
- `supabase/config.toml` - Supabase configuration

## Dependencies

- [ ] Supabase CLI installed and configured
- [ ] PostgreSQL knowledge for advanced schema design
- [ ] Understanding of multi-tenant architecture patterns
- [ ] Knowledge of Row Level Security best practices

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: false (foundation for all other tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Database schema implemented and deployed locally
- [ ] All RLS policies tested with different user roles
- [ ] Migration scripts validated and can be run repeatably
- [ ] Seed data successfully populates development environment
- [ ] Performance tests pass for expected query load
- [ ] Database documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Code reviewed by team member with database expertise
- [ ] Schema changes deployed to Supabase development environment
