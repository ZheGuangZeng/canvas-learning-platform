# Task: Performance Optimization Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive performance optimizations across the Flutter application, including caching strategies, lazy loading, image optimization, database query optimization, and mobile-specific performance enhancements. Achieve performance benchmarks of <2s page load time and <100ms video call latency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Page load times under 2 seconds on 3G connections
- [ ] Video call latency under 100ms with HD quality maintained
- [ ] Database query response times under 200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Real-time messaging latency under 200ms
- [ ] Mobile app maintains 60fps scrolling and <500ms touch response
- [ ] Aggressive image caching with compressed thumbnails
- [ ] Offline support for critical application data
- [ ] Memory usage optimization preventing excessive garbage collection
- [ ] Bundle size optimization with code splitting and tree shaking

## Technical Details
- **Flutter Performance Optimizations**:
  ```dart
  // Lazy loading with pagination
  class CourseList extends StatelessWidget {
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ListView.builder(
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          if (index >= courses.length) {
            loadMoreCourses(); // Trigger pagination
            return CircularProgressIndicator();
          }
          return CourseCard(course: courses[index]);
        },
      );
    }
  }
  ```
- **Image Optimization**:
  - Progressive JPEG loading with blur-to-sharp transition
  - WebP format conversion with fallback to JPEG
  - Thumbnail generation (150x150, 300x300, 600x600)
  - CDN caching with Supabase Storage optimization
  - Lazy loading images outside viewport
- **Database Query Optimization**:
  ```sql
  -- Indexed queries for course listings
  CREATE INDEX idx_courses_user_enrollment ON enrollments(user_id, course_id, created_at);
  CREATE INDEX idx_messages_room_timestamp ON messages(room_id, created_at DESC);
  ```
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - **Level 1**: Flutter in-memory cache for UI state
  - **Level 2**: Local storage cache for user preferences and recent data
  - **Level 3**: Supabase query caching for database results
  - **Level 4**: CDN caching for static assets and media files
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**:
  ```dart
  // Route-based code splitting
  GoRoute(
    path: '/course/:id',
    builder: (context, state) => DeferredWidget(
      () => import('package:app/screens/course_detail.dart'),
      loading: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    ),
  );
  ```
- **Mobile-Specific Optimizations**:
  - Battery usage optimization for background video calls
  - Network-aware content loading (WiFi vs cellular)
  - Touch gesture optimization and haptic feedback
  - Adaptive bitrate for video based on device capabilities
- **Real-time Performance**:
  - WebSocket connection pooling and efficient subscription management
  - Debounced user input to reduce API calls
  - Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution
  - Background sync for offline-to-online state transitions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Multi-tenant UI (007) - Complete UI implementation for optimization
